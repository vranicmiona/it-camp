        <h3>Adenosine Triphosphate Definition</h3>
        <p>This is a molecule that carries energy within cells.It is the main energy currency of the cell,and it is an end product of the processes of photophosphorylation (adding a phospate group to a molecule using energy from light),cellular respiration,and fermentation.All living things use ATP.In additon to being used as en energy source,it is also used in signal transduction pathways for the cell comunitation and is incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) dyuring DNA synthesis.</p>
